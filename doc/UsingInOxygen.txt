To validate in oXygen we would suggest modifying your Docbook or DITA framework as follows:

Go to the Preferences->Document Type Association panel.  Select the DTA you want to update (I typically use cals.sch with DocBook5 and DITA (topics)).

Click the validation tab and then the '+' at the bottom of the window.

Then add a new validation scenario, with the following columns:

URL of the file to validate:    ${currentFileURL}
File Type:                      XML Document
Validation Engine:              <Default Engine>
Automatic Validation:           ticked

Open the next dialog to browse to your location for cals.sch by clicking the button in the final column.

In the 'Specify Schema' dialog:  use custom schema,   browse to your cals.sch location,
For schematron phase I would recommend #ALL or structure.

Carefully click OK through about 4 levels of preferences windows.
