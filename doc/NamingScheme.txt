The naming scheme we started with was derived from the "full CALS" spec, or OASIS 9502:1995 CALS Table Model DTD:
  https://www.oasis-open.org/specs/tm9502.html

In the HTML document there are tables and most of the semantic rules lie within them.  
  Tnn  specifies the table number 
  Rn  specifies the row
  and then we've numbered the constraints individually A, B, C etc.

Most of the rules in 'full CALS' are also used in the 'exchange subset', or OASIS 9901:1999 XML Exchange Table Model DTD:
  https://www.oasis-open.org/specs/tm9901.html

This specification doesn't use the numbered tables, but does have numbered sections which can be refered to.
Here is a mapping of the constraints between the two specs.  The table (yes we could use CALS :-) has a phase
column which corresponds to the 4 ordered schematron phases used.

Finally in the full spec, the fact that the tgroup/@cols is > 0, is constrained through the DTD number type, while
in exchange it is a semantic constraint.
