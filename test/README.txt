These files are used to check cals.sch

Currently they are manually loaded into oXygen and the the validate button is pressed.
This is after the docbook5 DTA in the preferences is configured to use cals.sch

Note the issues with phases - it may be necessary to specify a specific phase rather than #ALL for some
of these test files.  Note the 'Reset Cache and Validate pull-down menu next to the validate button.

Hopefully we (and oxygen) will have a better schematron runner.
